    "\n",
    "Our ship will be equipped with short-range sensors which detect the distance, in kilometers, of large objects that pose a danger to the craft. This device has a range of 10 kilometers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with programming a warning system which reacts to key events in the data fed to you by the sensor. Assume the sensor returns one number every second: the distance from the ship to the most significant feature in space that may pose a danger. Your task is to filter the results such that significant results are reported. Specifically, you must develop a function which:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Takes a vector of any length as input. This is the test sensor data taken over a previous time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Scans the data for groups of three numbers which are all within 10% of each other. For each group of such numbers, the function prints the index of the first member of the group and the mean of the group. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Of the groups found in step (2), records each triplet as its own entry in a running log and prints the total count of all such events at the end of the function call.\n",

    "4) BONUS POINT: The function should, at the end, output a sorted array of the means of each of the groups found in step (2), along with their indices in the original data vector."
